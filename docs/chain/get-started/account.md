## Chain Portal
Centrifuge hosts an instance of the chain portal at [portal.chain.centrifuge.io](https://portal.chain.centrifuge.io). You can use it to interact with a full node provided by Centrifuge. The portal serves all three of our permanent networks.

**Mainnet:** https://portal.chain.centrifuge.io/#?rpc=wss://fullnode.centrifuge.io<br />
**Amber:** https://portal.chain.centrifuge.io/#?rpc=wss://fullnode.amber.centrifuge.io<br />
**Flint:** https://portal.chain.centrifuge.io/#?rpc=wss://fullnode.flint.centrifuge.io



## Create an account/key pair using the Portal UI
1. Open the Portal
1. Create a new account for your user by navigating to "Accounts" and clicking "Add account".

    Fill in the form, e. g. for Peter Parker: ![](./create-account.png)

1. Click "Save" and then "Create and backup account". Make sure you save the downloaded JSON file in a safe place.

1. Done! You can now copy your address and send it to others to receive tokens. The address is the string starting with `5...` under the name of your account, e. g. `5HKk5u...wp29Zd` in the following. You can copy it by clicking on the icon to the left of your account name: ![](./account-address.png)


## Getting Tokens
### Mainnet
A faucet is available giving out 0.1RAD per user per day at [faucet.chain.centrifuge.io](https://faucet.chain.centrifuge.io)


### Amber/Flint
You can get the testnet tokens _Amber Radial (ARAD)_ or _Flint Radial (FRAD)_ from BlockXLabs' faucet:

 [BlockXLabs Faucet](https://faucets.blockxlabs.com/centrifuge)

If you have a need for more ARAD or FRAD than what the faucet provides, we can send you more on a case by case basis. Please reach out to us at chain@centrifuge.io with a description of what you want to use the tokens for and your address so we can send you the appropriate amount.
