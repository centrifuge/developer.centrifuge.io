## Build a Use Case

Welcome to the bonus mission of Discord missions!
Submit a PR to our documentation under this section and provide a potential use case that Centrifuge can tap into, using the following categories:

- **Through the lens of an asset originator**
  
  Commercial RealEstate Rental/Lease Contracts.
  
  There are many property developers/owners that lease property using long term, medium term and short term contracts.
  Developers often rely on selling/leasing space off the plan to raise the necessary capital to start construction. From the perspective of a developer Centrifuge can be very beneficial to raise capital for construction.
  
    Building Owners/Lessors typically have long tern and medium terms contracts with fixed rental income which could be leveraged to secure capital for property invesmtent or new construction. The expectation is that these investment increase revenue and therefore ability to service any debt.
  
  NFTs can be based on approved development plans and allow relatively granular allocation i.e. per square meter/square foot.
  
  There are well etablished legal and financial standards and mechanisms that would allow standardised asset vetting and defaul recovery.
  
  
- **DeFi protocol composability**
  - Centrifuge has started working with MakerDAO and Aave to create instant liquidity for Tinlake pools. What are other great partnership use cases for Centrifuge?

   This is likely to be best suited for longer term instituational investors and therefore any project that would allow access to this market would be necessary/required.
   The investment is likely to have longer maturity 6 months+.

- **Centrifuge Chain (the home for RWA)**
  - Centrifuge Chain is built for RWA origination. Tinlake is a great use case of what can be done with the Centrifuge chain. What are some other cases you can see for the Centrifuge chain?

    The value of the construction in the US is approx. USD S80B/annum, for Australia is it AUD $55 million/annum. There would be a opportunity to establish pools based on geaography with jurisdiction specific asset and investor vetting 
- 
- **Polkadot**
- 
  - Interoperability is crucial for DeFiâ€™s success. What are some other projects in the Polkadot ecosystem that you think Centrifuge should integrate with?

For any of these categories above ðŸ‘‰ submit a PR to detail how each use case could work. Make sure to think about the entire flow, technology, and size of the potential!
