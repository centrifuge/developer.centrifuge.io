Tinlake uses an interest rate mechanism that is typically implemented as compounding per second. The implementation can be found in [github.com/centrifuge/tinlake-math](https://github.com/centrifuge/tinlake-math).

Below we show abstract examples of how this is calculated:

| Variable | Description | 
|----------|-------------|
| $P$ | Principal |
| $D$ | Debt |
| $rate$ | interest rate per second |
| $n$ | the number of times the interest is compounded, compounding is once per second, so "n" is seconds past since last calculation|
| $\mathtt{R}$ | Nominal interest rate (5% would be 0.05) |
| $\mathtt{A}$ | Annual Percentage Rate (APR) |
| $\mathtt{y}$ | constant, seconds in a year: $3600 \cdot 24 \cdot 365 = 31536000$ | 

The basic formula is:
 
$$
D = P \cdot rate^{n}
$$

Debt equals to Principal (or the previous debt amount) times rate to the power of seconds since last calculation.

## Example: Interest rate compounding per second

$$
P = 100 \newline
r = 0.05 \newline
n = 3600 \cdot 24 \cdot 365 = 31536000 \newline 
$$

Using the formula above, the Debt $D$ after half a year 
$(n = \mathtt{y} / 2 = 15768000)$ would result in $D = 102.5315$.

After one year ($n = \mathtt{y}$) the $D$ would be $105.1271$.

Thus a 5.00% interest rate compounded every second is equivalent to an annually compounded rate of 5.127%. 

The annual percentage rate $\mathtt{A}$ could also be calculated directly from the percentage rate $\mathtt{R}$ (using $n = \mathtt{y} = 31536000$):

$$
\mathtt{A} = (1 + \frac{\mathtt{R}}{\mathtt{y}})^\mathtt{y} = 1.05127
$$

### Rate per Second 

To calculate the Debt, we initialize an interest rate in Tinlake with a variable called `ratePerSecond` or $rate$. The ratePerSecond represents the interest accrued per second in Tinlake.

$$
rate = 1 + \frac{\mathtt{R}}{\mathtt{y}}
$$


### Calculate Debt

$$
D = P * rate^t
$$

The debt can be calculated by multipling the principial $P$ with $rate$ to the power of $n$. The variable $n$ represents the time passed in seconds since the loan has been borrowed.

Continuing the example from above for annual interest:

$$
rate  = 1 + \frac{0.05}{31536000} = 1.0000000015854900 \newline
D = 100 \cdot 1.0000000015854900^{31536000} = 105.1271
$$

## Using an annual percentage rate (APR) in Tinlake

The Tinlake User Interface uses an annual percentage rate (APR) as input. Tinlake transforms this annually compounded rate $\mathtt{A}$ into the equivalent rate used for compounding per seconds $rate$. This is achieved by solving the equation:


$$
\mathtt{A} = (1 + \frac{rate}{\mathtt{y}})^\mathtt{y}
$$
for $r$:
$$
r = \mathtt{y} \cdot (\mathtt{A}^{\frac{1}{\mathtt{y}}}-1)
$$

Using the calculated $r$ compounding every second leads to the same amount of debt like using $\mathtt{A}$ compounding annually over the course of a year. Thus, the calculated `rate` can be used to achive an interest per year (APR) behaviour with the compounding per second implementation in Tinlake.

Continuing the example from above with an 5.00% annual interest rate (APR):

## Decimal Precision
We use fixed precision decimals for any monetary amounts. Interest Rates are typically of type `ray` with 27 digits precision and amounts are of type `wad` which has 18 digits precision. 

This is usually explicitally mentioned in throught the codebase.
