## What is Tinlake?
[Tinlake](https://centrifuge.io/technology/tinlake) is a set of smart contracts that enables borrowers to draw loans against non-fungible assets, such as invoices, mortgages, royalty payments or warehouse receipts. Anything that can be represented on-chain as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) can be financed using the Tinlake infrastructure. This is done by issuing an ERC20 token, the Collateral Value Token (CVT), against all of the collateral NFTs that are deposited into the Tinlake contracts.

Please find more information in the [Tinlake Developer Documentation](https://developer.centrifuge.io/tinlake/overview/introduction/) and the Blogposts [here]FT for standardized assets. Also note, that Tinlake DEMO is deployed on the [Kovan](https://kovan-testnet.github.io/website/) testnet, thus there is no real money involved.

## Limitations
Tinlake, Tinlake DEMO, Centrifuge Protocol and all its components are Beta Software and in an early stage of their development. The set of smart contracts and its UI have a limited feature set compared to the end-vision. Not all features are implemented yet, and tradeoffs between security, speed, end-user features, and protocol flexibility are made continuously. This might and will lead to substantial changes in the future, re-architecture, addition and removal of features, as well as unexpected behavior. Use at your own risk.
