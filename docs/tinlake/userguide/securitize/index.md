After you have signed the subscription agreement and the issuer has accepted your subscription.

Click on the provided link to [Tinlake](https://tinlake.centrifuge.io). There you connect your Ethereum wallet with the Ethereum address you have entered in the subscription agreement. Please follow the [Tinlake Investor Guide](/tinlake/investment-guide/investor-guide/) for the next steps.

_**Please ignore all portfolio information on Securitize. Your single source of truth is your holding of TIN or DROP tokens of the respective Tinlake pool and the information, which the immutable and censorship-resistant decentralized asset financing protocol Tinlake is providing on Ethereum. Securitize is not supporting decentralized token issuance on Ethereum.**_
