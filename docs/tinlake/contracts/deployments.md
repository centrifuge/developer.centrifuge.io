## Tinlake Deployments
Tinlake's set of smart contracts can be deployed in different configurations that are generally independent of each other. Each lender to a deployment shares the risk of all assets within the specific deployment, but not from any other deployment. Likewise, all the parameters of a deployment can be configured differently. These parameters may include interest rates, CVT conversion rates, etc. This allows for each deployment to be fully customized. The modular architecture (see the section below) allows anyone to customize the behavior of a deployment by configuring the modules differently, or by replacing certain modules altogether.
