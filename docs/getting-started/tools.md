To get started quickly, we recommend using two services that will make your life easier:

<!--## Ethereum Wallet (TBD if included)
To be able to send and receive payments and convert from fiat to crypto the user must have a wallet that is funded with ETH.-->


## Infura
In order to interact with Ethereum and the Ethereum testnets you need to install the corresponding node. To get started quickly we recommend that you use Infura instead of hosting your own Ethereum node. Infura is a SaaS platform that provides API and developer tools for easy and secure access to Ethereum. In other words, it is core infrastructure that serves as a gateway to the blockchain. 

Register and create an Infura account here: https://infura.io/. Create a new project. 



## Postman
To be able to manage documents on Centrifuge OS the user will have to make API calls. Instead of doing this via the command line we recommend a handier approach via Postman. Create an account here: https://www.getpostman.com/ and import the [Centrifuge collection](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/0d9126c8586a03af7cc7).
